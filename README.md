# Integration-Project
>This is a Java project, but it is categorized as an HTML project because it mostly contains HTML due to the documentation in the docs directory.

This project was built when I was taking Intro to Programming (early 2018). This project, which is written in Java, contains examples of fundmantal programming principles that would apply to most other programming languages.
